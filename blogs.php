						As Christmas Day draws near, thousands of sparkling colourful lights and artistically crafted lanterns litter the country’s busy streets and narrow alleys. These common sights, together with the euphoric excitement brought by the much-anticipated festive, make the Filipino Christmas a heart-warming and one-of-a-kind experience.
					</p>

					<p>
						Philippines is known for celebrating the longest and merriest Christmas season around the globe. As early as September, Filipinos start a Christmas countdown, decorating their homes and offices with anything that relates to the Yuletide Season and keep these ornaments until the Feast of Epiphany or Three Kings on the first week of the following year. Throughout this period, a mixture of western and native Filipino traditions are observed.
					</p>

					<p>
						For most Filipinos, no festive holiday is complete without Christmas symbols and decorations. To get a head start, thrifty locals shop for Christmas decorations in the markets of Divisoria in Manila and Dapitan Trade in Quezon City, among others, as early as possible to avoid the madness. Due to its low-priced goods, these markets get crazy busy and crowded as the Christmas season rolls around.
					</p>

					<p>
						With the presence of various markets and malls across the country — from cheap bargain bazaars to high-end shopping complexes — and with the emergence of online shopping platforms, Filipinos can easily find a market to perfectly suit the things they will be needing for Christmas ornaments.
					</p>

					<p>
						Once all materials are set, Filipinos decorate their homes with dazzling lights, strung about in festoons, stars, angels, Santa Claus, Christmas trees, and in a large variety of other ways.
					</p>

					<p>
						Households and buildings are also adorned with iconic star lanterns, called parol, which is the ultimate symbol of Christmas in the country. It represents the star of Bethlehem that guided the Three Kings to the manger. It emits warmth, joy and harmony, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness and the Filipinos’ hope, especially during hard times.
					</p>

					<p>
						Another popular Filipino Christmas decoration is the belen — a tableau representing the nativity scene or the birth of Jesus Christ. Belens, which are usually made from wood, ceramic and recycled materials, can be seen in homes, offices, schools, and churches. It is a typical scene at schools to showcase plays where students act as the Holy Family and the Magi, recreating the Christmas belen.
					</p>

					<p>
						While being proactive with the decor, practical Filipinos also shop for gifts during the lean season to avoid hassle and stress, as roads get so congested during the Christmastime.
					</p>

					<p>
						Although the Christmas season starts in the Philippines as early as September, the official observance by the Catholic Church in the country is from the beginning of the Simbang Gabi — a nine-day series of early morning masses to honour the Blessed Virgin Mary — on Dec. 16.
					</p>

					<p>
						As a predominantly Catholic nation, many Filipinos adhere to the tradition of Simbang Gabi, wherein people wake up at the break of dawn to attend mass at their local churches. Attending these masses is one of the many ways for Filipinos to show their devotion to the Divine being and as a spiritual preparation for the commemoration of the Saviour’s birth.
					</p>

					<p>
						After observing a Simbang Gabi, it is a common tradition for Filipinos to tickle their taste buds with delectable traditional delicacies sold outside the churches such as bibingka and puto bumbong. Bibingka is a round rice cake made with rice flour and coconut milk, baked in a clay oven with the coals underneath and on top. It is topped with cheese and egg or salted egg, and brushed with butter. Meanwhile, puto bumbong is a rice cake made of steamed black glutinous rice called pirurutong, which is cooked in bamboo. It is served with margarine, grated coconut, and palm sugar granules.
					</p>

					<p>
						Dec. 16 also marks the beginning of one of the light-hearted Christmas traditions in the country, the carolling. A group of kids, as well as adults, would travel to villages with their musical instruments, expecting a handful of coins from the householders after singing Christmas carols under the twinkling stars in the sky. It is certainly the best time to belt those tunes and sing your heart out.
					</p>

					<p>
						Some of the most popular Filipino traditional songs sung by carollers, even up to these days, are Ang Pasko ay Sumapit, Sa Paskong Darating, and Namamasko (Sa May Bahay ang Aming Bati), among others.
					</p>

					<p>
						Christmas celebration in the country culminates with the Noche Buena on Christmas Eve. It is a grand feast full of delicious native and foreign cuisines like roasted pig, sweet ham, pork barbeque, pancit, queso de bola and fruit salad. While celebratory dinners are universal, what makes Filipino Noche Buena different is the presence of each family members. Aside from dining together, it is also the time when families open their Christmas presents.
					</p>

					<p>
						On Christmas Day, Filipinos traditionally visit the homes of their relatives so the kids can pay respect to their uncles, aunts and grandparents. Usually, the children line up to perform a Filipino greeting of respect called pagmamano. Most of the time, the children are rewarded with aguinaldo or gifts like toys or money.
					</p>

					<p>
						With more than four months of celebration, Christmas in the Philippines is truly one of a kind. But more than the red block date on the calendar, the gleaming decor around, the presents underneath the Christmas tree, the feast and the banquet spread on the table, it should be kept in mind that Christmas is all about the love of God, the birth of the Saviour of all mankind.

						<h4> DTI Crafts Road Map for AI, Fourth Industrial Revolution </h4>

					<p>
						The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is crafting a road map for the country’s artificial- intelligence (AI) sector that will outline how industries will take impact from and prepare for the full swing of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
					</p>

					<p>
						Trade Undersecretary Rafaelita M. Aldaba last week signed an agreement with data scientists Christopher P. Monterola and Erika Fille T. Legara for the formulation of an AI road map. Aldaba said the creation of the road map “is very important and timely,” as it comes at a time technology is becoming part of the daily life.
					</p>

					<p>
						With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or the age of digitization, governments from across the world are seeking ways on how to keep their labor force competitive in the face of firms adopting new solutions, particularly automation, in their operations.
					</p>

					<p>
						“The formulation of the AI road map is very important and timely. This effort provides the impetus that will move the country forward to keep up with the rapidly changing times,” Aldaba said in a news statement on Monday.
					</p>

					<p>
						Part of the crafting is the establishment of an AI task force, comprised of academicians, state officials and industry stakeholders, tasked to support the initiative.
					</p>

					<p>
						According to the DTI, the road map will analyze how AI will impact the country’s industries and labor force, and recommend policies and programs that are necessary for soft landing, such as the conduct of trainings and building of laboratories. Further, the agency will evaluate the risks and opportunities the Fourth Industrial Revolution presents to the economy.
					</p>

					<p>
						For their part, Monterola and Legara of the Asian Institute of Management’s Aboitiz School of Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship created the framework to be used in the crafting of the road map, which shall be data driven and consultative in nature.
					</p>

					<p>
						Aldaba said the formulation of the road map should lead the way toward making the country an AI powerhouse in the region. She invited, therefore, all stakeholders to work with the DTI in the implementation of the road map initiative.
					</p>

					<p>
						“With all of us—government, academe, industry—working together, our aspiration to become an AI center of excellence would be achieved,” the trade official said.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Philippines obtained a score of 5.704 and a ranking of 50th among 194 economies in the Government AI Readiness Index 2019 of the Oxford Insights and the International Development Research Centre. In the region, the country placed third next only to Singapore, which topped the list, and Malaysia at 22nd.

					<p>
						The business process outsourcing (BPO) industry (BPO) is considered insulated from the impact of the trade war, unlike the manufacturing sector, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) said.
					</p>

					<p>
						They added that the Philippines continues to be attractive for BPO investors due to low costs and English-language skills.
					</p>

					<p>
						“I think the Philippines is very unique and could reap the benefits of having an English-speaking population… (US companies) are very happy with the outsourcing and (can be expected to) continue to outsource their activities to the Philippines,” Leong Sook Mei, ASEAN Head of Global Markets Research for MUFG told reporters in a briefing Friday in Makati.
					</p>

					<p>
						Ms. Leong added that the industry is unlikely to be a direct competitor in BPO because of its underdeveloped service economy.
					</p>

					<p>
						“It’s something that I think is very hard to take away because China is not into the same kind of deal or the service sector that the Philippines (is). The closest competitor is probably India. But even then, I think there has been a lot of issues over the BPO operations in India,” Ms. Leong said.
					</p>

					<p>
						Marie Diana Lynn C. Singson, head of Global Corporate Banking at MUFG Manila, said that the low cost is what makes the Philippines attractive, despite global trade tensions.
					</p>

					<p>
						“I think BPOs are relatively shielded from the trade wars… Companies set up BPOs precisely because they want to minimize costs… even with a trade war, I don’t think we will see it affecting the BPO business,” Ms. Singson said.
					</p>

					<p>
						Any impact of trade tensions could show up in another pillar of the economy, remittances.
					</p>

					<p>
						“I think, may be a little bit (of impact) on remittances. Manufacturers are impacted by the fact that they can’t export as much… But I think for BPO not really,” Ms. Singson said.
					</p>

					<p>
						President Rodrigo R. Duterte has said that India and the Philippines and India should boost ties to complement each other’s strengths in the global IT and BPO industries.
					</p>

					<p>
						During a visit to Manila in October, Indian President Ram Nath Kovind said India is looking to expand business opportunities with the Philippines in the digital industries, start-ups, health, and agriculture.
					</p>

					<p>
						The BPO industry generated between $24.5 billion and $24.8 billion in revenue in 2018, according to estimates from the Information Technology and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP). Despite the pickup, it was short of the association’s targets.
					</p>

					<p>
						“I think there was a prevailing discussion around the overall uncertainty, really and what we have said in the past, it’s less about what eventually the fiscal regime will be. It’s more about how are we managing the predictability of fiscal forecasts,” IBPAP President and CEO Rey E. Untal told members in May, referring to the possible impact of tax reform and incentives rationalization.
					</p>

					<p>
						Such uncertainties could take their toll on the industry and prevent it from hitting its $40 billion revenue target by 2022.

						Potential for developing the Internet economy in the Philippines remains the biggest in Southeast Asia, according to an annual Google-led report that said the region can be expected to breach the $100-billion mark in gross merchandise value (GMV) this year.
					</p>

					<p>
						The 2019 e-Conomy report released on Thursday, which Google conducted in partnership with Temasek Holdings Pte. and Bain & Co., said Southeast Asia’s Internet economy shot up almost 40% to break the $100-billion mark this year. Growth was fueled by online travel, e-commerce, online media and ride hailing sectors. “This pace of growth has exceeded all expectations. At this rate, the Southeast Asian Internet economy is on track to hit $300 billion by 2025, topping our initial projection in 2016 by $100 billion,” it said.
					</p>

					<p>
						The report also showed that in the Philippines, the Internet economy now makes up 2.1% of gross domestic product (GDP), and could be equivalent to 5.3% of GDP by 2025.
					</p>

					<p>
						“Of the six Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines has the most room for growth,” the report said, comparing the country to Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.
					</p>

					<p>
						While Indonesia and Vietnam were found to be the leaders in Southeast Asia’s robust Internet economy in terms of proportion to GDP, the Philippines’ young and English-speaking population buoys the country’s potential.
					</p>

					<p>
						It said there is a “growth surge” in the country’s online media sector, which recorded a compound annual growth rate of 42% to $2 billion this year from in 2015. “Subscription Music and Video Streaming services are especially popular among young Filipinos who are well-acquainted with English content,” it said.
					</p>

					<p>
						E-commerce also drove the increase in value of the country’s Internet economy, growing 47% to $3 billion in the same four-year period.
					</p>

					<p>
						The report noted investments in the Philippines’ digital financial services grew sixfold to more than $300 million last year from $50 million in 2017, largely due to fund raising by Voyager Innovations, Inc., Coins.ph and First Circle Growth Finance Corp.
					</p>

					<p>
						Ride hailing grew 35% to $1 billion in 2019 from in 2015, despite regulatory constraints, limited driver supply and lack of competition in the country.
					</p>

					<p>
						The value of online travel likewise grew 16% to $2 billion.

						However, the report noted growth of the Internet economy is still largely limited to Southeast Asia’s capital cities.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the Philippines, for example, the Internet economy is valued at $273 per capita in Metro Manila, but is $39 per capita for cities beyond the National Capital Region.
					</p>

					<p>
						The report said this only shows the “wider gap in living standards and infrastructure between those living in metros and elsewhere.”
					</p>

					<p>
						But the Internet is seen to also drive opportunities for less developed regions. The report explained that as technology’s impact spills over to ride hailing and food delivery, the Internet economy can become a “powerful lever” to drive growth in regions outside major cities. “Central and regional administrations are taking notice and working to make the Internet economy a key plank of their policies, with the aim of promoting inclusion,” it said.

						The Philippines is home to billions worth of foreign investments. No wonder why startups continue to flourish, making the country the next startup hub in Asia. In Q2 2016 records, the country’s total approved foreign investments is reported to have risen by 11.5% compared with figures from Q2 2015.
					</p>

					<p>
						Among the investment promotion agencies tasked to help prospective investors establish their startup business in the Philippines is the Philippine Economic Zone Authority or PEZA.
					</p>

					<p>
						PEZA was established in 1995 to “promote investments, extend assistance, register, grant incentives to and facilitate the business operations of investors in export-oriented manufacturing and service facilities inside selected areas throughout the country proclaimed by the President of the Philippines as PEZA Special Economic Zones.” It oversees the development of IT Parks or areas that house world-class and environment-friendly infrastructures, support facilities, and other amenities for enterprises in IT-related fields.
					</p>

					<p><strong> Benefits of PEZA Accreditation </strong></p>

					<p>
						Included in the mandate of PEZA is the granting of incentives to companies that register for accreditation, provided they operate in PEZA Zones. These zones, which include IT Parks and economic zones in manufacturing, agro-industrial, tourism, and medical tourism, among others, are key areas located nationwide and have been identified as central drivers of the Philippine economy.
					</p>

					<p>
						PEZA’s fiscal and non-fiscal incentives are designed to help startup investors obtain the best return on their capital. Here’s a rundown of the benefits that PEZA-accredited enterprises are entitled to.
					</p>

					<p><strong> 1. Fiscal Incentives exempt firms from paying taxes and other local fees or charges, including: </strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Income tax holiday (ITH) – Corporate income tax is waived 100% for the first four to six years of operations
						</li>
						<li>
							Special income tax – Upon expiration of the ITH, a preferential 5% tax exemption is applied to gross income
						</li>
						<li>
							Tax and duty-free importation – Applicable to importation of raw materials, capital equipment, machinery, and parts
						</li>
						<li>
							Zero percent VAT – When purchasing local goods or services for use in the business activity
						</li>
						<li>
							Exemption from payment of local government taxes and fees for permits or licenses
						</li>
						<li>
							Exemption from local business and real property taxes
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong> 2. Non-fiscal Incentives include services and assistance for firms’ operations and entry into the market, such as: </strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Simplified import-export procedures
						</li>
						<li>
							Hiring of non-resident foreign nationals for supervisory, technical, or advisory positions
						</li>
						<li>
							Special non-immigrant visas with multiple entry privileges for non-resident foreign employees and their spouses and children below 21 years old
						</li>
						<li>
							Visa facilitation assistance for foreign employees and their spouses and dependents
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Startups in the Philippines, whether local or foreign, help keep the business landscape in the Philippines alive and progressing. With these PEZA benefits, the Philippines is indeed ideal for setting up your startup business and should get you going to add to the next batch of the country’s valuable investors.
